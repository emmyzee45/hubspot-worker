## Debrief on potential improvements
### 1) Code Quality and Readability:
- Enhance error handling and logging beyond basic try-catch blocks.
- Clearly define method names and responsibilities (e.g., fetchMeetingAttendees needs a robust implementation).
- Add inline documentation for complex logic, such as action type determination and attendee fetching.
### 2) Project Architecture:
- Decouple components using dependency injection and interfaces.
- Introduce abstract base classes or interfaces for modular and testable code.
- Expand the processAction method into a robust event-driven architecture.
### 3) Code Performance:
- Optimize for large-scale processing with parallelism (e.g., Promise.all) or queue systems.
- Improve pagination and rate-limiting mechanisms.
- Implement caching, throttling, and backoff strategies to reduce API load and handle rate limits effectively.
### 4) Performance and Scalability Enhancements:
- Add caching layers and bulk API operations.
- Use retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.
- Consider moving to a message queue system for meeting processing.
